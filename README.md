# KeySAVe

KeySAVe is an application to decrypt and dump Generation 6&7 Pok√©mon save files.

This is the version that was originally released running the app in Electron.
The app is now being rewritten to work directly in your browser, it is highly recommended you follow development on that in the [master](https://github.com/Cu3PO42/KeySAVe) branch!

If you are reading this, I assume you want to run KeySAVe from the source:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build-server`
3. `npm run build-client`
4. `npm start`

If you want to use hot module reloading run the following in two seperate terminals after installation:

1. `npm run hot-server`
2. `npm run start-hot`

That's all for now folks!
