# KeySAVe

KeySAVe is an application to decrypt and dump Generation 6&7 Pok√©mon save files.
If you are reading this, I assume you want to run KeySAVe from the source:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build-server`
3. `npm run build-client`
4. `npm start`

If you want to use hot module reloading run the following in two seperate terminals after installation:

1. `npm run hot-server`
2. `npm run start-hot`

That's all for now folks!
