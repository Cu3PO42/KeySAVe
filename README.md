# KeySAVe

KeySAVe is an application to decrypt and dump Generation 6&7 Pok√©mon save files.

This branch tracks the development of the new web version which will run directly in the browser.
If you are interested in the old Electron-based version, please check out the [electron](https://github.com/Cu3PO42/KeySAVe/tree/electron) branch or grab a release from the [releases](https://github.com/Cu3PO42/KeySAVe/releases) page.
